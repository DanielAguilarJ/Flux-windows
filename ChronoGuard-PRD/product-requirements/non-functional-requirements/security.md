# ChronoGuard - Non-Functional Requirements: Security

## 1. Data Protection

### 1.1. User Data Encryption
- All sensitive user data, including personal information and configuration settings, must be encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit).

### 1.2. Secure Storage
- User credentials and sensitive configuration data must be stored securely using secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Windows Credential Locker).

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

### 2.1. User Authentication
- The application must support secure user authentication mechanisms, including:
  - Password-based authentication with strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
  - Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.

### 2.2. Role-Based Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users have access only to the features and data necessary for their role.

## 3. Compliance

### 3.1. Regulatory Compliance
- The application must comply with relevant data protection regulations, including:
  - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union.
  - California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for users in California.

### 3.2. Privacy Policy
- A clear and comprehensive privacy policy must be provided to users, detailing how their data will be collected, used, and protected.

## 4. Security Audits and Testing

### 4.1. Regular Security Audits
- Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

### 4.2. Penetration Testing
- Perform penetration testing prior to major releases to ensure that the application is resilient against common attack vectors.

## 5. Incident Response

### 5.1. Incident Response Plan
- Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address potential security breaches, including:
  - Procedures for identifying, containing, and mitigating security incidents.
  - Communication protocols for notifying affected users and relevant authorities.

### 5.2. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time, ensuring that logs are stored securely and are tamper-proof.

## 6. User Education

### 6.1. Security Awareness
- Provide users with educational resources on best practices for securing their accounts and data, including guidance on creating strong passwords and recognizing phishing attempts.

### 6.2. In-App Security Notifications
- Implement in-app notifications to inform users of important security updates, potential vulnerabilities, and recommended actions to enhance their security posture.
