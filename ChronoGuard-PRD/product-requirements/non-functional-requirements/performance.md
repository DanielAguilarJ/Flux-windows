# Performance Requirements for ChronoGuard

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the performance requirements for the ChronoGuard application, ensuring that it meets user expectations for speed, responsiveness, and resource efficiency.

## 2. Response Time
- **User Interface Responsiveness**: The application should respond to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, slider adjustments) within 100 milliseconds to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Color Adjustment Application**: Changes to color temperature settings should be applied within 500 milliseconds to provide immediate feedback to users.

## 3. Resource Usage
- **CPU Usage**: The application should maintain CPU usage below 2% during normal operation, ensuring minimal impact on system performance.
- **Memory Usage**: The application should use less than 100MB of RAM during standard operation, allowing it to run efficiently alongside other applications.

## 4. Scalability
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: The application should efficiently manage color adjustments across multiple monitors (up to 8), maintaining performance without significant degradation.
- **Concurrent Users**: The application should be able to handle multiple concurrent users (if applicable in a future multi-user scenario) without performance loss, ensuring that each user experience remains unaffected.

## 5. Startup Time
- **Application Launch**: The application should start up within 3 seconds on an SSD, providing a quick access point for users.

## 6. Background Processing
- **Background Service Efficiency**: The background service responsible for location detection and color adjustments should operate with minimal resource consumption, ideally under 1% CPU usage when idle.

## 7. Performance Monitoring
- **Logging and Telemetry**: The application should include performance logging to monitor resource usage and response times, allowing for ongoing optimization and troubleshooting.

## 8. Performance Testing
- **Automated Testing**: Performance tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that performance benchmarks are met with each release.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct user acceptance testing to gather feedback on performance from real users, ensuring that the application meets their expectations in practical scenarios.

## 9. Conclusion
These performance requirements are critical to ensuring that ChronoGuard provides a seamless and efficient user experience. Adhering to these guidelines will help maintain user satisfaction and application reliability.
